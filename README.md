# dbEngDocs

## Overview

dbEngDocs is a Python 3 and MongoDB app that uses Mongoengine to size and manage cable sizing for electrical cables. 
The app allows the definition of electrical cables and cable runs to allow the automatic selection of cables based on 
the electrical load requirements. The app uses Mongoengine to allow the definition of schema to ensure consistency of 
date imported into the system and to provide a query system.

For the foreseeable future the app will be based around the requirements of Australian Standards as the basis of 
standards conformity and design methodology. It is hoped that this will be expanded in the future to allow the use 
alternate standard systems as part of a broader internationalisation approach.
